# HacamaTech-V6
A cutting-edge medical AI agent built on Gemini 3, designed to bridge 1400 years of traditional Hijama &amp; Leech therapy with modern surgical precision. Features spatial anatomical mapping, recovery tracking, and holistic nutrition guidance.

## Inspiration
Traditional therapies like Hijama and Leech therapy have offered healing for over 1400 years. However, in the modern era, these practices often lack anatomical precision and long-term digital tracking. I was inspired by the idea of bringing "Ancient Wisdom" into the "AI Age." My goal was to eliminate human error in point selection and provide a holistic health companion that respects traditional lunar cycles while utilizing cutting-edge medical AI.

## What it does
HacamaTech V6.0 is an advanced AI agent that transforms traditional therapy into a high-precision medical workflow.

- **Anatomical Mapping:** Uses Gemini 3’s spatial reasoning to identify 10 critical Hijama points with surgical accuracy.

- **Holistic Integration:** Features dedicated modules for Leech Therapy (Sülük) and Post-Therapy Nutrition.

- **Lunar Intelligence:** Automatically calculates Hijri "Gold Days" (17th, 19th, 21st) for optimal treatment timing.

- **Marathon Tracking:** Monitors the patient's recovery phase and provides data-driven health insights.

## How we built it
The project is built on the **Gemini 3 Flash** architecture, utilizing its advanced multimodal capabilities.

- **Vibe Engineering:** We developed a "Surgical Telemetry" UI that provides real-time feedback on anatomical synchronization.

- **Spatial Logic:** We used complex coordinate mapping to ensure that treatment points are locked to the human silhouette.

- **Agentic Workflow:** We designed a "Marathon Agent" system to manage the long-term recovery process, shifting the AI from a simple chatbot to a clinical assistant.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was Spatial Hallucinations. Early versions saw treatment points "floating" in the air or misaligned with the anatomy. Coordinating Gemini's creative generation with strict medical boundaries required intense prompt engineering and "Coordinate Lock" protocols. Solving these spatial errors while operating on minimal sleep was a true test of "Marathon" spirit.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Surgical Precision:** Successfully forcing the AI to recognize the human spine as a $X=50$ baseline for point alignment.
- **Holistic Dashboard:** Creating a UI that feels like a premium medical suite rather than just a simple image generator.
- **Resilience:** Transforming technical failures into a robust, self-verifying system that displays a "99.98% Confidence Score."

## What we learned
Building HacamaTech taught me that **"Vibe Engineering"** is just as important as hard coding. We learned how to guide Large Language Models to respect physical boundaries through descriptive spatial logic. Most importantly, I learned that a project’s strength lies in its ability to bridge the gap between human tradition and artificial intelligence.

## What's next for HacamaTech
The journey is just beginning.

- **AR Integration:** Bringing these points into an Augmented Reality (AR) environment for real-time practitioner guidance.

- **Real-time Vitals:** Integrating wearable data to adjust Hijama points based on the user's blood pressure and heart rate variability.

- **Global Practitioner Network:** Connecting HacamaTech users with certified professionals worldwide.
